CodeBlue
========

Real-time collaborative code editor. This project was started by Rashad Russell as a 
Web Monkeys project. The idea is for it to be used as a help-me tool for programmers. 
If someone have a bug in their code, or needs help coding an idea, the can receive 
real-time help using our text-editor. This will be one of Web Monkeys projects for the
2012-2013 school year.
